* Group By Multiple Field With Stream

** Reason
   
   Deal with list data with `group by` in SQL
   and need group by multiple fields

** Problem

   I found one solution for this problem and I need to find a more
   elegant solution for this.
   

** Thoughts
*** why not build a package do thing like sql do with database
**** why not generate the result as row in database
